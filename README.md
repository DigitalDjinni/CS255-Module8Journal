Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

	The idea behind the DriverPass project was to develop a driver training program that would offer online classes to its users to better prepare them for passing their drivers test. The owner of DriverPass was the client however he wanted the apps to be used by his clients who would not only be able to use it for online classes but they would also be able to schedule driving lessons from packages offered. 

What did you do particularly well?

	For this project I think I did projects 1 and 2 extremely well overall. I did however find the business requirement document for project 1 to be easier to develop then the system design document in project 2. Thinking about the system and its functional, user interface, and assumptions was much easier for me then creating UMLs especially the class diagram UML.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

	If I could choose one part to work on and revise it would be the UML class diagram. I feel I did ok with my other diagrams (sequence, and activity diagrams) but when it came to the UML class diagram this one was a nightmare to create. To improve upon it I would make some of the objects private and public as well as try to break it down even more and add the functions that would be in each object. I feel this would explain easier how they interact and would make it better for my developers to understand.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

	I interpreted the user’s needs by dissecting the transcript between my team and the owner of DriverPass. By listening to exactly what he wanted in his system application and building around those requirements and needs I was able to create a finished product that he and his customers would enjoy. It is important to consider the users needs because it his his needs you are trying to fulfill to have a successful product and a happy customer. Without listening to the needs of the user you will either have a product that takes more time to develop with features that are costly that the user didn’t need or you will have a product that may under perform that would lack needed features and leave the user dissatisfied. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

	To approach software design you need to communicate with the customer that you are designing for and see what the end goal is and what exactly they need in their software. You then need to talk to your developer team and see what is feasible and what isn’t with the boundaries that your customer gave you (budget wise, time wise, etc) once your done with this you go back and rediscuss the project with the customer and show them things such as activity UMLs and sequence UMLs and explain what is possible and how the program could interact. The main goal and strategy is to keep a transparent relationship between your developers and the client and to make sure everyone is on the same page with strong communication for the whole process.
